### Install

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. This project depends on a lot of utilities in [s3pipe package](https://github.com/BRAIN-Lab-UNC/s3pipe). Install it first from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/s3pipe/) or clone it into your local PYTHONPATH

### How to use it
simply run
```
python s3reg.py
```
and follow the instructions for deformable spherical surface registration
```
python s3reg_rigid_align.py
```
for rigid spherical surface alignment.
